## Above & Beyond
- Used the RIT Web Style Guide to style header to brand specifications.
- Added select dropdown & functionality to pagination to allow user to select how many results to display per page.
- Custom styled the pagination component and dynamically hide/show the previous and next buttons based on the current page.
- Ensured that the page was responsive down to 320px width. (when making the window smaller, the tab component at the bottom will cause a glitch so you will have to refresh or press on the tab component)
- I wanted to use intersection observer so that the side-nav would show you what section you were on, but I couldn't get it working consistently.
